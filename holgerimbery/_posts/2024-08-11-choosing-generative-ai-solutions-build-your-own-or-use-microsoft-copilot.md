In the realm of artificial intelligence, particularly regarding generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), organizations often engage in debates over which model is superior. The discourse frequently revolves around terms like “goodGPT” or “betterGPT,” with the implication being that one large language model may outperform another. However, this conversation tends to oversimplify the complexities involved in selecting an AI solution.

The crux of the matter extends beyond the superficial comparison of AI models. It delves into strategic considerations such as the “build vs. buy” dilemma and the overarching governance and data privacy themes. The decision to either develop a proprietary AI system (“build”) or to procure an existing solution (“buy”) is not one to be taken lightly.

Building or buying approaches have their merits and can be the right choice under different circumstances. The “build” option allows for high customization and control over data governance, which can be crucial for organizations with stringent data privacy needs. On the other hand, the “buy” option offers a quicker route to deployment and may come with established security and compliance measures, which can be appealing for organizations looking to implement AI solutions rapidly.

Ultimately, the decision should stem from a well-informed evaluation of the organization’s unique needs. This includes assessing the ability to meet data protection standards, whether through internal capabilities or through the assurances provided by a vendor. In essence, the “build vs. buy” decision is not just a technical choice but a strategic one that should align with the organization’s data privacy policies, resource availability, and long-term goals. It’s a decision that reflects the organization’s commitment to responsibly harnessing the power of AI while upholding the trust of those whose data is being processed.

This article will explore the criteria for making this decision, focusing on two prominent offerings in the **Microsoft ecosystem**: **Microsoft Copilot** and **Azure AI Studio**.
