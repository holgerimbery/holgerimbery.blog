Attending a "Power Virtual Agent in a Day" (PVAinaDay) workshop is highly recommended when beginning with Power Virtual Agents. After conducting numerous workshops alongside colleagues and utilizing our script to engage participants, we adopted Microsoft's new "Power Virtual Agents in a Day" curriculum.

## Motivation

With the new Microsoft Learn-based curriculum, everyone can participate in the PVAinaDay workshop, with or without an instructor. However, there are many more aspects to explore after the seminar. That's why I've created a curated list of links to my articles and external sources, which will guide you on your journey to becoming a proficient Power Virtual Agent bot keeper.

## Power Virtual Agents in a Day - Instructor-Led Workshop

This course offers hands-on experience designing and developing a chatbot in less than a day.

Participants will learn how to:

1\. Review the prerequisites and setup process for the bot.

2\. Build their first chatbot.

3\. Experiment with topic suggestions.

4\. Enhance chatbots using entities and variables.

5\. Integrate bots with other Microsoft Power Platform products.

6\. Understand the authentication process.

7\. Share the bot with the group and interact using Microsoft Teams.

You can [Register for an event](https://events.microsoft.com/allevents/?view=list&language=English&clientTimeZone=1&startTime=07:00&endTime=11:00&search=power%20virtual%20agents).

## Training Content

In this learning path, you'll complete hands-on activities using Microsoft Power Platform, specifically Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate.

It is designed for use with the Power Virtual Agents in a Day instructor-led course but can also be used as a self-study course.
