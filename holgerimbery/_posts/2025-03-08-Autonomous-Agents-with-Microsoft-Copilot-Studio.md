## Costs for Autonomous Agents

Deployment costs for autonomous agents in Microsoft Copilot Studio are based on a metered model, calculated by the number of actions the agents perform. Organizations can choose between prepaid capacity packs or pay-as-you-go billing options, providing flexibility in managing expenses. For detailed pricing information, refer to the [Microsoft Copilot Studio pricing page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/enabling-agents-in-microsoft-365-copilot-chat/?msockid=3f6b995950606d311da58c0351ac6c26).

The usage of agents is measured in "messages", and the total cost is calculated based on the sum of messages used by your organization. You can purchase messages through the Copilot Studio meter in [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account/search?ef_id=_k_20a9a241b9021b97a234c5c70cba9e80_k_&OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM__k_20a9a241b9021b97a234c5c70cba9e80_k_&msclkid=20a9a241b9021b97a234c5c70cba9e80), a pay-as-you-go option, for ($/€) 0.01/message, or via pre-paid message packs priced at ($/€) 200 for 25,000 messages/month.  

The Microsoft Power Platform admin center sets up billing and assigns message capacity to Copilot Chat and individual agents. Agent message usage varies with an agent’s complexity, frequency, and the use of specific features. These features have been categorized into five groups, including three new ones introduced today. 

| Copilot Studio feature                | Consumption rate |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Web grounded answers (new)            | 0 messages       |
| Classic answers                       | 1 message        |
| Generative answers                    | 2 messages       |
| Tenant Graph grounding for messages (new) | 30 messages      |
| Autonomous actions (new)              | 25 messages      |
