## Organize the ideas

It can be challenging to understand if you have a whiteboard filled with ideas that are all over the place. Copilot in Whiteboard can help you organize your ideas into clusters based on similarity. This way, you can easily find patterns, themes, and categories in your brainstorming. However, please note that to use the Categorize feature, you need to have at least two notes on your Whiteboard, and this feature only works with sticky notes, not Ink or text boxes. You can access Categorize in Whiteboard using the following methods.

* Toolbar Copilot Button
    
    * Select the **Copilot** button next to the Whiteboard toolbar. In the Copilot menu, choose **Categorize**. Copilot will automatically select all the notes visible on the Whiteboard.
        
    * Click **Categorize** to start the process or **Cancel** to stop and exit the process.

Copilot is a note-taking tool that categorizes your notes into different groups with headings using different colors. After Copilot categorizes your notes, you can either Keep them, Revert them to being uncategorized, or Regenerate Copilotâ€™s categorization if you're not happy with the result. Once your notes are categorized, you can edit, move, and delete them, as well as modify the headings as per your needs.

## Understand your ideas

You might want to share the outcomes following a productive brainstorming session on Whiteboard. Similarly, a concise summary may be necessary after a thorough planning session. The Summarize feature in Copilot for Whiteboard makes it easier to comprehend complex whiteboards.

The summary will only include the content from sticky notes. For the Summarize feature to work, your whiteboard must have at least one sticky note, although having multiple notes is advised to maximize the benefit of this feature.

Accessing the Summarize feature in Whiteboard is possible through several methods:

* Toolbar Copilot Button
    
    * Click on the Copilot button adjacent to the Whiteboard toolbar. From the Copilot menu, choose Summarize to generate a summary of the Whiteboard.
        
* Right-Click Menu
    
    * Right-click on a space within the Whiteboard. From the context menu that appears, select Summarize to initiate the creation of the whiteboard summary.
        

Copilot is designed to compile a summary of the notes taken on the Whiteboard and seamlessly integrate them into a Loop component. This component can then be conveniently edited, duplicated, and distributed among colleagues or customers.
