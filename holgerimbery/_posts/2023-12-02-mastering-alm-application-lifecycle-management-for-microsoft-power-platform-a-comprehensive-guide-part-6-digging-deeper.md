You can use GitHub Actions for Microsoft Power Platform and other available GitHub Actions to create your build and release workflows. Common workflows implemented by teams involve setting up development environments, exporting from a development environment to source control, generating builds, and deploying applications.

### How to Begin

You can utilize GitHub Actions for Microsoft Power Platform by incorporating the actions into your workflow definition file (.yml). Example workflow definitions can be found in [the GitHub Actions lab](https://github.com/microsoft/powerplatform-actions-lab).

### **Connection to environments**

To interact with a Dataverse environment, you must create a secret allowing the various GitHub Actions to perform the necessary tasks.  
Therefore, you need to work with the following:  
Service principal and client secret: This connection type utilizes service principal-based authentication and supports multi-factor authentication. Service principal authentication  
You can follow the steps [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools#configure-service-connections-using-a-service-principal) and work with easy-to-understand command line commands, for example:

get Tenant ID/ApplicationID/Secret

```bash
pac admin create-service-principal --environment d3fcc479-0122-e7af-9965-bde57f69ee1d
Connected as admin@M365x57236726.onmicrosoft.com
Successfully assigned user adde6d52-9582-4932-a43a-beca5d182301 to environment d3fcc479-0122-e7af-9965-bde57f69eeld with security role System Administrator
Tenant ID                            Application ID                       Client Secret                           Expiration
2b0463ed-efd7-419d-927d-a9dca49d899c adde6d52-9582-4932-a43a-beca5d182301 beY8Q~JBZ~CBDgIKKBjbZ3g6BofKzoZkYj23Hbf 7/31/2024 4:27:03 PM
```

and assign it to your environment

```bash
pac admin assign-user --user "adde6d52-9582-4932-a43a-beca5d182301" --role "System administrator" --environment d3fcc479-0122-e7af-9965-bde57f69ee1d --application-user
Connected to... SnDemoDev
Connected as admin@M365x57236726.onmicrosoft.com
Successfully assigned user adde6d52-9582-4932-a43a-beca5d182301 to environment d3fcc479-0122-e7af-9965-bde57f69ee1d with security role System Administrator
```

### Available Actions

There are actions to:  
[**Microsoft Power Platform development**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-github-available-actions) and  
[**Microsoft Power Platform administration**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-github-available-administrative-actions)

### Examples

Remember: Many actions necessitate connecting to a Microsoft Dataverse environment. You can include service principal in your GitHub repository and utilize them in the workflow.

For information on setting up secrets in GitHub, visit [Using encrypted secrets in a Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow).

Once correctly configured, you can invoke the service principal within your action scripts.

In your GitHub Actions script, [define the following parameters as environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables):

* Application ID: `APPLICATION_ID:<your application id>`
    
* Tenant ID: `TENANT_ID:<your tenant id>`
    

The client secret will be stored as a GitHub secret and referenced from within the action script using a parameter like a client secret: ${{secrets.APPLICATION\_ID}}.

Example export and branch a solution:

```yaml
name: export-and-branch-solution
# Export solution from DEV environment
# unpack it and prepare, commit and push a git branch with the changes

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
