## Infrastructure  
I have recently transitioned my blog to a new infrastructure.

This change was prompted by some unforeseen issues with the Hashnode platform, which led me to seek a more stable and customizable solution. 

As a result, the blog now operates on Azure as a static web app, utilizing Jekyll as the static site generator. This setup allows me to maintain a simple, yet effective, blogging environment without the need for a complex CMS —  just pure *Markdown*.

## Old articles

For those of you who have been following my blog for a while, please note that articles older than January 24th have been archived. You can find them in the dedicated “archive” section. The cover image for these articles has been updated to picture of "a library with a hidden door".

## Newsletter

There will be no newsletter or subscribe system until further notice. 

## Main URI
The blog now operates under the main URL [holgerimbery.blog](https://holgerimbery.blog). To ensure a smooth transition and maintain compatibility with older links, previous domains such as [the.cognitiveservices.ninja](https://the.cognitiveservices.ninja) and [aiassistant.studio](https://aiassistant.studio) are being redirected to the new main URL. These redirects will be maintained temporarily to help ease the transition for all visitors.

## Medium
[holgerimbery.blog](https://holgerimbery.blog) is my main blog, and I will continue posting articles on Medium.


## The Cognitive Service Ninja
The Cognitive Service Ninja was a name I used for a blogging project that has now reached its conclusion. My name is Holger Imbery, and I have always posted under my real name. Moving forward, I will continue to do so. The Cognitive Service Ninja brand will be phased out over the coming weeks as I transition fully to using my real name. This change marks a new beginning for my blog, [holgerimbery.blog](https://holgerimbery.blog), where I will continue to share my insights and updates. Let's welcome this new chapter with enthusiasm and look forward to the fresh content and perspectives that will come with it.

## Thank you
Thank you for your continued support and understanding during this transition period. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out! There is a new "get in touch button" in the top right of the blog

Yours,  
Holger
