**summary lede**: Discover how Microsoft Copilot Studio empowers business users to create and customize AI agents with ease. This curated guide offers a comprehensive overview, hands-on workshops, and essential resources to help you become a citizen developer and leverage the full potential of Copilot Studio.

## Background and Overview

Microsoft Copilot Studio is a graphical, low-code tool designed to help users create and customize AI agents for various scenarios and channels. It allows users to build automation with Power Automate or extend existing Copilot Solutions like Microsoft 365 Copilot with enterprise data and scenarios. Copilot Studio connects to other data sources using prebuilt or custom plugins, creating sophisticated logic for powerful and intuitive agent experiences. You should use Copilot Studio when creating agents to perform tasks, interact with customers, or answer common employee questions. It is available as both a standalone web app and a discrete app within Teams.

The low-code/no-code approach offers several benefits, including quicker turnaround times, improved productivity, and reduced errors. It allows business users to create applications without extensive programming knowledge, empowering them to become citizen developers. This approach is essential because it democratizes software development, enabling standard business users to build and launch applications up to 80% faster. Organizations can innovate more rapidly and efficiently by enabling citizen developers, reducing the strain on IT resources.

Copilot Studio provides extensibility for various copilots, including Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service Copilot. You can customize Microsoft 365 Copilot by building declarative agents and adding actions and knowledge with plugins and Microsoft Graph connectors. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Copilot can be extended to automate actions and workflows, providing real-time AI assistance to help agents handle cases efficiently. Additionally, Copilot Studio allows you to extend other copilots with over 1,100 prebuilt and custom connectors, eliminating the need for expensive IT resources.

Agents and autonomous agents are AI systems designed to perform tasks independently. An agent is a powerful AI companion that can handle a range of interactions and tasks, from resolving issues requiring complex conversations to autonomously determining the best action to take based on its instructions and context. On the other hand, autonomous agents are computational systems that inhabit complex dynamic environments, sense and act autonomously, and realize a set of goals or tasks for which they are designed. These agents can improve productivity by performing tasks to assist users and organizations, engaging with customers and employees across various channels.

![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holgerimbery/holgerimbery.blog/main/holgerimbery/images/2025/02/0.svg) Overview

This immersive workshop provides participants with hands-on experience in constructing and personalizing intelligent agents within both Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Microsoft Copilot Studio environments. Throughout the session, attendees will progress through creating a declarative agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat before advancing to Microsoft Copilot Studio to develop and refine a custom engine agent. The practical exercises include building a Contoso support agent that leverages various sophisticated capabilities such as agent knowledge repositories, integrated tools, agent workflows, generative orchestration techniques, and autonomous functionalities.

Designed specifically for business professionals, citizen developers, and information technology specialists seeking to enhance their understanding of AI agent development, this workshop delivers a thorough introduction to the platform's extensive capabilities. Participants will gain valuable insights into creating their own customized agents and extending existing Copilot solutions through structured, practical learning experiences that build technical competency and confidence with the technology.
