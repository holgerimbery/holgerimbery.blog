A curated list of links will help you get started with Copilot Studio. If you are a business user looking to create conversational AI applications without extensive programming knowledge, this will empower you to become a "citizen developer".


## Background and Overview

Microsoft Copilot Studio is a graphical, low-code tool designed to help users create and customize AI agents for various scenarios and channels. It allows users to build automation with Power Automate or extend existing Copilot Solutions like Microsoft 365 Copilot with enterprise data and scenarios. Copilot Studio connects to other data sources using prebuilt or custom plugins, creating sophisticated logic for powerful and intuitive agent experiences. You should use Copilot Studio when creating agents to perform tasks, interact with customers, or answer common employee questions. It is available as both a standalone web app and a discrete app within Teams.

The low-code/no-code approach offers several benefits, including quicker turnaround times, improved productivity, and reduced errors. It allows business users to create applications without extensive programming knowledge, empowering them to become citizen developers. This approach is important because it democratizes software development, enabling standard business users to build and launch applications up to 80% faster. Organizations can innovate more rapidly and efficiently by enabling citizen developers, reducing the strain on IT resources.

Copilot Studio provides extensibility for various copilots, including Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service Copilot. You can customize Microsoft 365 Copilot by building declarative agents and adding actions and knowledge with plugins and Microsoft Graph connectors. In Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Copilot can be extended to automate actions and workflows, providing real-time AI assistance to help agents handle cases efficiently. Additionally, Copilot Studio allows you to extend other copilots with over 1,100 prebuilt and custom connectors, eliminating the need for expensive IT resources.

Agents and autonomous agents are AI systems designed to perform tasks independently. An agent is a powerful AI companion that can handle a range of interactions and tasks, from resolving issues requiring complex conversations to autonomously determining the best action to take based on its instructions and context. On the other hand, autonomous agents are computational systems that inhabit complex dynamic environments, sense and act autonomously, and realize a set of goals or tasks for which they are designed. These agents can improve productivity by performing tasks to assist users and organizations, engaging with customers and employees across various channels.
