## What are the limitations of Copilot in Outlook, and how can users minimize their impact when using the system?

When dealing with a very long email thread, the Summarize feature might not include older messages in its summary due to limitations on how much data can be processed. Users might see a warning indicating that the summary doesn't cover the entire thread.

The Draft with Copilot feature does not limit the length of the prompt. When replying to a message using Draft with Copilot, it will consider the context of the message or thread. However, in the case of a very long thread, it might not include all messages due to processing limits.

For Coaching by Copilot, drafts shorter than 100 characters cannot use this feature.

Copilot features in Outlook are only available in a user's primary mailbox. They are not accessible in archive, group, shared, or delegate mailboxes, and they do not work on mailboxes not hosted on Exchange Online.

Currently, Copilot cannot access encrypted emails. However, support for Microsoft 365 Message Encryption emails, where the ExtractAllowed property is true, is coming soon. Copilot will not support other encryption methods, such as S/MIME or Double Key Encryption.

## A final word on prompts

The way you ask your CoPilot for help is critical, including the following points when relevant:

* Your goal,
  
* *give context*
  
* describe your expectations and
  
* name the source
