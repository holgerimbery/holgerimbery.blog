In the fast-paced sales world, staying on top of leads and opportunities can be daunting. But what if you had an AI assistant to help you out? Enter Copilot, a feature in Dynamics 365 Sales that’s revolutionizing the way sales teams operate.

## What is Copilot?

Copilot is an AI assistant integrated with Dynamics 365 Sales. It uses generative AI to summarize opportunities and leads, generate meeting preparation notes, and even compose emails. It’s designed to help sales teams be more productive and efficient in their daily work.
