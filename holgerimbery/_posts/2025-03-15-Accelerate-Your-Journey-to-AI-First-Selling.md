## New Sales Agents for Enhanced Sales Capabilities

Two new agents, Sales Agent and Sales Chat, are introduced to enhance the ability to nurture and close deals efficiently.

* **Sales Agent** is designed to transform contacts into highly qualified leads, enabling your sales representatives to focus on closing the most significant deals while ensuring that no potential lead is overlooked. This intelligent agent operates autonomously around the clock, continuously working to expand your sales pipeline by researching leads, scheduling meetings, and proactively reaching out to customers. For low-impact leads, the Sales Agent can even complete the sale independently. The agent can personalize every interaction by leveraging data from your CRM, company resources such as price sheets, and information available on the web, along with Microsoft 365 data, including emails and meetings. This comprehensive approach ensures that each response is tailored to the specific needs and context of the customer, ultimately driving more effective and efficient sales processes.

* **Sales Chat** is designed to significantly accelerate the sales cycle by providing sales representatives with the critical information they need to succeed. This intelligent agent helps sales reps quickly get up to speed on new accounts and thoroughly prepares them for customer meetings. By leveraging data from CRM systems, pitch decks, meetings, emails, and the web, Sales Chat delivers actionable insights that enable sales reps to spend less time searching for information and more time engaging with customers and closing deals.

With Sales Chat, sales reps can use simple, natural language prompts to access the necessary information. For example, they can ask, “Give me a list of deals at risk of falling through,” and receive a comprehensive list of at-risk deals, allowing them to take proactive measures to salvage those opportunities. They can also inquire, “What should I know going into tomorrow’s meeting with this customer?” and receive a detailed briefing on the customer, including recent interactions, key pain points, and potential opportunities. Additionally, Sales Chat can assist in strategic planning by responding to prompts like “help me create a plan to close this deal,” providing a step-by-step action plan tailored to the specific deal and customer context.

By integrating seamlessly with existing sales tools and data sources, Sales Chat ensures that sales reps have all the information they need at their fingertips, enabling them to make informed decisions and drive sales success. This powerful tool not only enhances productivity but also improves the overall effectiveness of the sales team, leading to better customer relationships and increased revenue.
