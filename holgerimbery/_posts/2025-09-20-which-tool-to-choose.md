## How Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry Work Together
Think of Copilot Studio as the “front door” for your users. It provides the chat interface in Teams, Outlook, or on a website. Users type questions or requests there. Azure AI Foundry is the “engine room” behind the scenes. It handles the heavy lifting: advanced reasoning, searching large knowledge bases, and using custom AI models.

**Customer Support Chat**

A user asks a question in Teams.
Copilot Studio captures the question and sends it to a secure API.
That API calls Azure AI Foundry, which uses a large language model and your company's documents to create an accurate answer.
The answer is sent back to Copilot Studio and shown to the user in the chat. This simple workflow can be implemented **entirely within Copilot Studio for straightforward scenarios** but benefits from Azure AI Foundry's advanced capabilities when dealing with complex queries.


**Knowledge Search (RAG)**

A user asks, "What is our vacation policy?"
Copilot Studio sends the question to a workflow.
The workflow searches your company's documents using Azure AI Search.
Foundry combines the search results with the question and generates a precise, grounded answer.
Copilot Studio displays the answer with links to the original documents. This simple workflow can be implemented **entirely within Copilot Studio for straightforward scenarios** but benefits from Azure AI Foundry's advanced capabilities when dealing with complex queries.



**Email Classification**

An email arrives in a shared mailbox.
A workflow sends the email text to Azure AI Foundry.
Foundry classifies it (e.g., HR, Billing, Technical) and drafts a response.
The system sends the draft back through Outlook and logs it in your CRM.
Copilot Studio can show the classification history to an agent if needed.


### Why This Matters

Copilot Studio makes it easy for users to interact without learning new tools.
Azure AI Foundry ensures the answers are accurate, secure, and based on your data.
Together, they create a system that is easy to use on the surface but very powerful behind the scenes.

## Benefits of Combined Use
Using both platforms together unlocks the best of both worlds:
- **Seamless User Experience**: Copilot Studio provides a polished, user-friendly interface for end-users, while Azure AI Foundry handles complex backend logic and data processing.
- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Leverage Azure AI Foundry's extensive model library and orchestration features to build sophisticated agents that can reason, learn, and adapt.
- **Scalability & Flexibility**: Azure AI Foundry's cloud-native architecture ensures scalability for high-demand scenarios, while Copilot Studio's low-code approach accelerates development cycles.  

## Business Impact Analysis
With regard to the three scenarios above:

**Customer Support Chat**  
_Challenge_:   
High support costs and inconsistent responses across channels.  

_Solution_:  
Copilot Studio provides the chat interface in Teams or on a website, while Azure AI Foundry retrieves accurate answers from internal knowledge bases and applies advanced reasoning.  

_Impact_:
