GPT is a new and evolving system, so it may produce text that is not what you expected or wanted. Please be aware that the text generated by GPT is based on data from the internet, which may contain errors or sensitive content. You should always check and verify the information before using it.

## The three ways to use CoPilot in Word

### Draft a document

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Note</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">This feature is available to customers with a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license or Copilot Pro license.</div></details>

Copilot can assist you in creating or editing documents effortlessly. You will notice the "Draft with Copilot" option when you begin a new document or line.

You can provide Copilot with a simple or complex description of what you wish to write. For instance, you might say "Write an essay about dad jokes" or "Create a paragraph about time management".

If you have a Copilot for Microsoft365 license, you can reference up to three of your files to help guide Copilot's drafting. Use the "Reference your content" button or type "/" followed by the file name in the compose box. This feature only accesses the files you select, ensuring your data remains private.

Once you provide Copilot with a description, it will create new content for you. You can keep, discard, or ask Copilot to generate a different version. You can also revise your initial description. Use "&lt;" and "&gt;" to navigate through Copilot's suggestions.

You can guide Copilot on refining its content directly in the compose box. For instance, by writing "Make this more concise," Copilot will adjust its content to be more succinct.

In an existing document, the "Inspire Me" button allows Copilot to continue writing for you, drawing inspiration from what you've already written.

### Transform your text

Rewriting and editing your documents can often take more time and effort than writing down your initial ideas. Copilot not only assists in creating new content but also transforms your existing content into a document you can be proud of.

To rewrite text or convert it into a table, highlight the text in your document. Next, click the **Copilot** icon located in the left margin next to your text. Select **Rewrite** from the menu to see new versions suggested by Copilot. If you want to tweak Copilot's suggestions, click **Adjust tone** or **Regenerate** to receive a fresh set of options.

If you want to visualize your text as a table, after highlighting the text, click the **Copilot** icon in the left margin. Select **Visualize as a table** from the menu, and Copilot will convert the text into a table format. You can click **Regenerate** for a new table or **Discard** to remove it.

To customize the table, use the Copilot compose box to specify adjustments, such as "*Add an empty third column.*"

### Chat about your document

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Note</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">This feature is available to customers with a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license or Copilot Pro license.</div></details>

You can access the **Copilot** feature by clicking on the Copilot icon in the **Home** tab of the ribbon. This helpful tool can answer both broad and specific questions about your document. You can engage in back-and-forth conversations to refine your queries, get summaries or detailed information about your document's content, or ask it to create ideas, tables, or lists that you can then copy and paste into your document.

When you ask for summaries or have questions about your document, Copilot will give you answers, references, and citations from where it got its information.
