#### AI chat for the web with commercial data protection (free)

When organizations and employees utilize generative AI services, it's crucial to comprehend how these services manage user and chat data. Since employee chats might contain sensitive information, Copilot is specifically designed to safeguard this data, as demonstrated here:

![source Microsoft: Commercial Data Protection]({{site.baseurl}}/images/clt1it1gu000409l95y1155ek.md/90f221f5-bdf6-409b-b93b-db15f46269ea.png)

<center>source Microsoft: Commercial Data Protection</center>

* Copilot utilizes Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) for authentication and only permits users to access Copilot with commercial data protection using their work account.
    
* An Entra ID user's tenant and user information is removed from chat data at the beginning of a chat session. This information is solely used to determine if the user is eligible for commercial data protection. Search queries initiated by prompts from an Entra ID user are not linked to users or organizations by Bing.
    
* Microsoft does not retain prompts or responses from Entra ID users when using Copilot. Prompts and responses are kept for a brief caching period for runtime purposes. Microsoft discards prompts and responses once the browser is closed, the chat topic is reset, or the session times out.
    
* Chat data sent to and from Copilot with commercial data protection is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-128) during the chat session. Microsoft has no 'eyes-on' access to it.
    
* Since Microsoft does not retain prompts and responses, they cannot be used as part of a training set for the underlying large language model.
    
* Advertising shown to Entra ID users is not targeted based on workplace identity or chat history.

Employees can use Copilot to quickly complete tasks, enhance creativity, or provide better customer support. All of this can be done with the assurance that user and business data is protected and will not be leaked outside the organization. For instance, Copilot can help employees swiftly generate content, analyze or compare data, summarize documents, acquire new skills, write code, and more. While employees engage in these activities, they can rest assured that their organizational data remains secure.

For example, you can ask Copilot to help you:

* **Understand the implications of a decision:** "What are the pros and cons of offline marketing strategies?" and "How can I measure the success of my offline marketing campaign?"
    
* **Learn new skills:** "What are the top 5 things I should know when managing a large project?" and "What is agile project management, and how does it differ from waterfall?"
    
* **Analyze data:** "If we're forecasting 7% EPS growth this coming quarter, how does our internal forecast compare with EPS growth in the top US public CPG companies?"
    
* **Summarize work PDFs open in Edge:** "Summarize the findings of this internal cybersecurity report and the top 3 concerns" and "What are the best practices for addressing these security issues?"
    
* **Write better code faster:** "Write a regular expression in Python that matches email addresses" or "How can I use the *unit test* module to write test units for my Python code?"
    
* **Plan a business trip:** "Where should I stay in Manhattan with a good running path nearby?"
    
* **Generate social media content:** "Use this messaging framework to create five social media posts describing its value to healthcare workers."
    

#### Microsoft 365 Copilot (graph-grounded) Chat (paid)

> IMPORTANT:  
> Copilot vs. Copilot for Microsoft 365  
> What are the differences between Copilot and Copilot for Microsoft 365?  
> Copilot is a generative AI service grounded in data <mark>from the public web in the Bing search index only</mark>. It <mark>doesn't have access</mark> to <mark>organizational resources or content within the Microsoft 365 Graph</mark>, such as documents in OneDrive, emails, or other data, <mark>even when commercial data protection is turned on.</mark>
