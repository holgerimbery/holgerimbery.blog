Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service has introduced a game-changing feature known as Copilot. This AI-powered tool is designed to provide real-time assistance to customer service agents, enabling them to resolve issues faster, manage cases more efficiently, and automate time-consuming tasks.

## Key Features of Copilot

### Asking Questions

One of the standout features of Copilot is its ability to answer questions. When you sign in to any customer service agent apps, Copilot is ready and waiting in the right side panel with the 'Ask a question' tab. This feature allows you to ask free-form questions, just as you would ask a colleague or supervisor. Copilot then provides the most relevant answer from the knowledge sources your organization has made available.

### Drafting Emails

Another significant feature of Copilot is its ability to assist in drafting emails. It also provides a chat interface that allows quick summaries of sales opportunities and leads, updates, meeting preparations, account-related news, and much more.

### Summarizing Cases and Conversations

Copilot can summarize cases and conversations. The case summary includes critical information such as the case title, customer, subject, product, priority, case type, and description. For conversations, Copilot provides context and relays your steps to solve the issue.

### Generating Knowledge Drafts from Cases

If you select the option to propose a knowledge article for the case on the resolve case dialog, Copilot generates a knowledge draft when you choose to resolve.

### Using Filters

Copilot filters are another helpful feature. These filters help you generate responses based on a specific set of topics. They provide immediate context and reduce the chance of getting irrelevant responses when using Copilot.

### Language Support

Copilot is designed to detect your UI language and generate responses from cases and conversations in the language present in the UI.

### Analytics Report

With the Copilot analytics dashboard, supervisors and customer service managers can identify Copilot's impact on their customer service operations.

## How to Enable Copilot Features

To enable the Copilot features, you must have the role of System Administrator.
