**Welcome to my personal blog** — a resource dedicated to the Microsoft Power Platform (with a focus on Copilot Studio), Microsoft Azure AI Services, and Microsoft Dynamics 365, along with the background knowledge needed to use these technologies effectively.
My goal is to make AI concepts and Microsoft technologies easier to understand and apply. Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or looking for practical ways to improve workflows, this blog provides clear guidance and real-world examples.  
I work as a Principal Architect and Microsoft MVP, focusing on designing and implementing agentic AI systems that support autonomous decision-making and intelligent process automation in enterprise environments. My work centers on creating secure, scalable, and well-governed solutions using Microsoft Azure, Power Platform, and Copilot Studio. This includes building autonomous agents, cognitive services, and conversational AI systems that integrate into existing business processes. I also have experience delivering RPA solutions with Power Automate that improve efficiency and reduce costs.  
In addition to solution design, I lead adoption programs and technical workshops, such as "Agent in a Day", to help teams understand and implement AI-driven workflows.    
I also work to align technical architectures with organizational goals and ensure responsible AI practices are followed.  

Technical areas I focus on include:  
Copilot Studio for agentic workflows and autonomous (multi- ) agent systems  
Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents, Power Apps  
Azure Functions, Logic Apps, API Management  
Azure Cognitive Services (Language, Speech, Vision)  
Azure DevOps & GitHub for agile delivery  

This blog reflects my experience and interest in building intelligent systems that are practical, secure, and aligned with business needs. I aim to share insights and approaches that help others make informed decisions about AI and Microsoft technologies.

### generative AI transparency note
Utilizing AI-supervised content allows me to expand the material for my scenarios. It enables me to offer a broader range of examples across various programming languages, delve more deeply into solutions, and address new scenarios more quickly. As a non-native speaker, it enables me to write in proper English and avoid grammatical and orthographic mistakes. I use [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) to support me in this task.
